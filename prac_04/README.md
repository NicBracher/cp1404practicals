# Practical 04
I do shift-work at work and tend to do my practicals at work during down time, but due to policy I can't use a Git repo on my work computer or use my personal laptop at work but I can log into GitHub and use VSCode so if you're wondering why all the commits are within a few seconds of each other its because I'm downloading the programs onto my personal laptop, commiting them to my Git repo then syncing to GitHub...

I gotta work with what I got...
