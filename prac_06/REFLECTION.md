# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I now find I write a decent amonut of my code onto paper initially as a way to solidify the syntax.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Breaks mostly I think. The lecture videos tell me to have breaks and sometimes I do but more often than not I just start the next video.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Giving a lot of effort into the practicals. I tend to find one solution pretty quick but sit on the program for a while and think of ways to improve it.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Skim reading instructions and starting the practicals before reading the entire thing.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think more time descirbing what 'self' is in a class would be beneficial. I don't think I got a hold of it quickly and needed to keep circling back to understand what self was.
