# CP1404 Programming 2
  This repo contains my practical work for JCU's CP1404 - Programming 2 subject. I've updated this weekly and use it to keep notes about how I'm tracking along in the subjects e.g. what practical feedback I recieve.

## Clean Code
  Things about clean code that I've learnt during this subject:
  - You spend more time reading then writing code so make sure that the code is easily readable. Readability is more important than effeciency.
  - Funcation names should always be indicitave of what that function is actually doing.
  - Words mean things, if you use an adjective make sure it's the correct one e.g. 'get' would imply you are 'getting' something likely from the user.

## Practicals
  [Practical 1](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_01)
    Notes: Don't user i + 1 inside for loop for counting, just set i to 1 at the start
    
  [Practical 2](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_02)
    Notes: Following patterns, don't try to reinvent the wheel
    
  [Practical 3](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_03)
    Notes: Be careful using with for file processing, make sure only the required items are within the 'with'
    
  [Practical 4](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_04)
    Notes: Watch the plural naming, its better to sound a bit weird then be misleading
    
  [Practical 5](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_05)
    Notes: len is moer effecient then sum
    
  [Practical 6](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_06)
    Notes: Utilise the in condition when dealing with boolean logic, no need to always declare a variable
    
  [Practical 7](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_07)
    Notes:
    
  [Practical 8](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_08)
    Notes:
    
  [Practical 9](https://github.com/NicBracher/cp1404practicals/tree/master/prac_09)
    Notes:
